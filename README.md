INTRODUCTION

This repository has three files. Two of which are text files and one is pyyhon file. The purpose of the files is to execute a basic banking system that stores data using Python. The staff.txt file holds the staff details: username, password, email and full name of the staff. The customer.txt file holds the newly created bank account.

PROGRAM PROPERTIES AND FUNCTION

The program comprises of two functions, random module (for generating account number), and read and writing of file objects. The first function is verify_details: it logs the staff into or out of the system, compares the details inputed by the staff with pre-existing details in staff.txt and leads to the next function.

The second function is called account_creation. As the name implies it helps the staff create new bank accounts. The details inputed are saved to customer.txt.
